# NoxPortMapper
Nox Port Mapper is a (very) basic GUI for Open.NAT to simplify management of temporary port mappings.
As it is based on Open.NAT, it currently supports only UPnP and PMP compatible devices (most recent routers should be fine). It currently doesn't take care of firewall rules but it is planned for the future.
